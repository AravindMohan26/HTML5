Webpage - It contains an information in the form of content or design to connect with this and can perform some
actions.

A webpage is classified into 2 parts,

Static webpage and Dynamic webpage
 
Static webpage - The user cannot interact with the page and it is read only. EX: Online newspaper, any website content

To implement static web pages we need HTML

About HTML:

HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language

Properties of HTML:
*It is a presentation language
*it is not a case sensitive
*It is a platform independent
*It was introduced by W3C

Tags in HTML:

<Head>,<Body>,<Document type>,<H1>to<H6>,
<paragraph>,<href>,<br>,<ul>,<li>,<style>etc...

Dynamic webpage:

In this scenario user can interact with the page with some
limitations

EX:
Registering with any websites/webapplication,login,etc.

To implement dyanmic webpages we need HTML and Javascript

HTML - Design and readonly

javascript - Logic,validations

About javascript:

It is a scripting language

it is a case sensitive scripting language

A variable can be used directly without declaration

EX:var i;

javascript can be declared in both the head and body tags....

Syntax:
<head>
<Script language = "javascript">
</Script>
</head>

or

<body>
<Script language = "javascript">\
</script>
</body>

Javascript classes:

Math class - it is used to work with numeric function

Date class
Var d = new Date();
d.GetDate()
d.GetDateTime()
d.GetYear()
d.GetMonth()
d.GetDay()
d.GetHours()
d.GetMinutes()
d.GetSeconds()

String Class:

Var s ="abcd";
S.indexOf("c")->2
S.CharAt(1)->b

Email ID Validation:

*'@' should not be a first character
*An email id must contains'@'
*Minimum 1 char must be there in between @ and .
*space should not be allowed between the characters

S = f.t1.value(); -> @g.com
p1 = S.IndexOf("@")
p2 = S.IndexOf(".")
D=p2-p1
if(p1==0||d==1)
{
Alert("an entered emailid is invalid")
}
Else
Alert("An entered email id is valid")

Web Server - A WebServer is a software package which will provide the categorization 
of webpages with in the websites

We can create 2^120 websites towards a webserver

The webserver for.NET is internet information services(IIS)

Port Number: It is a logic which will connect the client system to the
server system.

The Default port number is 80/8080

Virtual Directory - Virtual directory is an alias directory for the physical directory which will be used to host the application
through internet manager(inetmgr)/IIS

Inpage Technique - When the design part and coding part are maintained in the same page, hence it is 
called as Inpage Technique

EX:HTML,JQuery,HTML5 Web pages

CodeBehind Technique - When the design part and coding part are being maintained in different pages, hence it is called as code behind
technique

EX:C#.net, vb.net, Asp.net
